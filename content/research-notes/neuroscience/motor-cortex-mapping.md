To design a high-fidelity non-invasive BCI, we must understand the anatomical source of our targeted signals: the primary motor cortex (M1), located in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe.

### The Motor Homunculus
M1 is organized somatotopically, represented visually by the "motor homunculus". Neurons controlling specific body parts are clustered in predictable regions along the gyrus:
- **Foot & Leg**: Medial wall of the hemisphere (deep in the longitudinal fissure).
- **Hand & Fingers**: Dorsolateral surface of the motor cortex (massive representation area).
- **Face, Lips, & Tongue**: Lateral and inferior regions.

### EEG Target Coordinates (10-20 System)
In non-invasive systems like **SynapseDecode**, we rely on the International 10-20 system to map electrodes to these cortical regions. The hand motor area maps directly to:
- **C3**: Left motor cortex (corresponds to right-hand motor imagery).
- **C4**: Right motor cortex (corresponds to left-hand motor imagery).
- **Cz**: Vertex/central midline (foot/lower-body motor imagery).

### Signal Dynamics: Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD)
When a subject merely *imagines* closing their hand, the underlying cortical neural populations begin firing asynchronously. This manifests in the macroscopic EEG as a local power reduction (attenuation) of the Mu (8-12 Hz) and Beta (13-30 Hz) rhythm bands. This attenuation is known as **Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD)**. 

Conversely, when the hand returns to rest, the neural populations resynchronize, producing a power burst known as **Event-Related Synchronization (ERS)**. By tracking the power ratio between C3 and C4, we can decode whether the user is imagining left or right-hand movement.
