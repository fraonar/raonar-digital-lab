These are the tools and references I rely on daily for research and engineering:

## Open-Source Datasets
1.  **PhysioNet BCI Motor Imagery Dataset**:
    -   *What it is:* A massive 64-channel EEG dataset recorded from 109 subjects performing imaginary hand and foot movements.
    -   *Link:* [PhysioNet EEG Motor Imagery](https://physionet.org/content/eegmmidb/)
2.  **Kaggle sEMG Gesture Recognition**:
    -   *What it is:* Surface electromyography (sEMG) recordings for 6 basic hand gestures.
    -   *Link:* [sEMG Gesture Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)

## Software Libraries & SDKs
-   **MNE-Python**: A fantastic, comprehensive Python package for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing human neurophysiological data (EEG, MEG, sEEG, ECoG).
    -   *Use Case:* Preprocessing raw EEG data, computing independent component analysis (ICA), and spatial topography plots.
-   **BrainFlow**: A uniform SDK to obtain, parse, and analyze EEG, EMG, ECG, and other biopotential data from biosensing boards.
    -   *Use Case:* Streaming data from OpenBCI Cyton directly into Python.

## Embedded Systems & Hardware Tools
-   **KiCad**: My absolute favorite EDA tool for PCB design. Open-source, fast, and powerful enough for complex high-frequency multi-layer boards.
-   **Saleae Logic 2**: Software for USB logic analyzers. Indispensable for debugging SPI, I2C, and UART line signals under clock frequencies up to 100MHz.

## Courses & Books
-   *Biomedical Signal Processing and Signal Modeling* by Eugene N. Bruce.
-   *Neural Engineering* by Bin He. Essential textbook outlining volume conduction, neural modeling, and signal transmission physics.
